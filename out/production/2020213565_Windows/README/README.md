# Wordle Game

[From Wordle - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle)

>***Wordle*** is a [web-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_game) [word game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_game) created and developed by [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_people) [software engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer) [Josh Wardle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wardle), and owned and published by [The New York Times Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Company) since 2022. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game [Jotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto) and the television game show franchise *[Lingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(American_game_show))*.
